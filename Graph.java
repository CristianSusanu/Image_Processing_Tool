 * This is an adjacency list representation of a graph.
 * Nodes are integers starting at 0. The textbooks usually describe
 * an adjacency list as a list (or array), indexed by node numbers,
 * of connection lists. If we did that in Java we would continually
 * end up checking for our node numbers being within range. Further,
 * we normally want a whole object for the node rather than just an
 * integer, so a {@code Map} instead of an array is a good choice.
 *
 * The graph is represented by a {@code Map} which maps the node number
 * to a LinkedList of Connection objects, which represent the nodes that
 * are directly connected to this node.

	 * 2 as that cannot cope with the priority of an object in the queue changing while
	 * the object is in the queue.

	 * Rather than using the arrays as described in the handout, I recommend you use
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>
	 * {@code Integer.MAX_VALUE} for infinity
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * A {@code Map<Integer, Integer>} for the {@code D} array in the notes, to record the
	 * minimum distance found so far from the start node for each node in the graph
	 * </li>
	 * <li>
	 * A {@code Set<Integer>} called {@code nonTight} of nodes to represent the set of nodes
	 * for which you have not yet found tight distance values for. This is equivalent to the
	 * {@code tight} array of booleans in the handout but it is much easier and more efficient to
	 * iterate over the {@code nonTight} set than iterate over the nodes whose boolean values
	 * in the {@code tight} array are true
	 * </li>
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>
	 * There is no need to have a {@code pred} variable as there is no need to calculate
	 * or return the route of the shortest path
